# Jirai Kei Library MVP - CoPilot Instructions

## Objective
Build a minimal viable product (MVP) of a Jirai Kei fashion database website (similar to LoLibrary), including:
- Browseable item catalog with categories, brands, tags, and images
- Search and filtering by tags, brand, and category
- Admin dashboard for adding/editing items
- Ready for AI enhancement and AWS deployment

Target: **MVP in 1 week**, deployed to AWS, using `jiraibrary.org` domain.

## Learning Guideline
**Important:** Since this project is also for learning:
- Always **explain the steps** clearly.
- Provide **reasoning** behind each piece of code or command.
- Include **how/why** each component fits into the overall architecture.
- Avoid giving just “copy-paste” answers; include explanations so I can understand and learn while building.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- **Frontend:** Django templates (minimal), CSS
- **Storage:** AWS S3 for images
- **Domain & DNS:** AWS Route 53 (`jiraibrary.org`)
- **Deployment:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk (or Lightsail for simpler start)
- **Optional AI features:** 
  - Image classification / tagging: CLIP / BLIP / pre-trained Vision Transformers
  - Text extraction / structured data: GPT-4o-mini or Claude 3.5
  - Future image similarity search: vector embeddings stored in FAISS or Pinecone

## Data Model (MVP)
### Models
1. **Brand**
   - `name` (string)
   - `country` (string, optional)
   - `description` (text, optional)

2. **Tag**
   - `name` (string)

3. **Item**
   - `name` (string)
   - `brand` (ForeignKey to Brand)
   - `year` (integer, optional)
   - `category` (choice: dress/top/bottom/shoes/accessory)
   - `description` (text)
   - `tags` (ManyToManyField with Tag)
   - `image` (image field / S3 URL)
   - `status` (choice: draft / approved) for human verification

---

## MVP Features
1. **Admin Panel**
   - Add/edit/delete items, brands, tags
   - Upload images to S3
   - Mark entries as approved
2. **Front-end**
   - Browse items by category and brand
   - Filter by tags
   - Item detail pages with image, description, brand, year, tags
3. **Optional AI helper for admin**
   - Suggest tags when uploading new items (using CLIP / LLM)
   - Suggest category / brand

## Week 1 Development Plan

### Day 1: Project Setup
- Initialize Django project: `django-admin startproject jirai_library`
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install django psycopg2 pillow boto3
- Configure PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- Set up Git repository

### Day 2: Models & Admin
- Create models: Brand, Tag, Item
- Register models in Django Admin
- Add sample brands/tags/items

### Day 3: Basic Frontend
- Create item list page (browse by category)
- Create item detail page
- Implement filtering by tags and brand
- Basic styling

### Day 4: Image Upload / Storage
- Integrate S3 for image storage (boto3)
- Admin can upload images directly to S3
- Display images on front-end

### Day 5: Search & Filtering
- Implement search by name / brand
- Filter by tags and category
- Test filtering and search functionality

### Day 6: Testing & Bug Fixes
- Local testing: add/edit/delete items, browse, filter
- Fix image rendering issues
- Prepare for deployment

### Day 7: AWS Deployment
- Set up Elastic Beanstalk environment
- Configure RDS, S3, and domain (Route 53)
- Deploy Django project
- Enable HTTPS with ACM SSL

## AI Integration (Phase 1)
- AI is optional for MVP, but can be included as “admin helper”
- Suggested tasks:
    - Tag suggestions: CLIP or zero-shot vision classifier
    - Category/brand suggestions: GPT-4o-mini or CLIP embeddings
- Workflow:
    1. Admin uploads image
    2. Script calls AI API → returns suggested tags/category/brand
    3. Admin confirms → saves to database

## Notes
- Keep MVP lightweight: focus on CRUD + browsing + filtering
- AI and automated crawling can be added later as Phase 2
- Human confirmation is mandatory for quality control if AI is used
- Costs to plan for:
    - AWS EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk: ~$10/month for MVP
    - RDS (PostgreSQL): ~$10–15/month
    - S3 storage: ~$1–5/month early
    - Domain: ~$12/year

AI API calls: depends on usage
## Future Roadmap
- AI-assisted image classification & tagging
- Image similarity search / visual search
- Automated web crawling for item discovery (with human verification)
- Community contributions (user accounts / submission queue)
- Premium or donation features to cover hosting costs
