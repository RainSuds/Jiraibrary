User: "What would go well with this?"
Bot: "These would pair perfectly with a pleated mini skirt and a 
     lace blouse! Let me show you some options..."
```

**API Integration Point**: `POST /api/chat`

### Styling Tips Generator
**Description**: Generate styling advice for specific items or combinations.

**Implementation**:
- Use GPT-4 to generate contextual styling tips
- Include care instructions, occasion suggestions, and pairing ideas

**API Integration Point**: `GET /api/items/:id/styling-tips`

## 5. Content Generation

### Product Descriptions
**Description**: Generate engaging product descriptions automatically.

**Implementation**:
- Use GPT-4 with prompts optimized for Jirai Kei aesthetic
- Input: item name, category, tags

2. Product description generator (Content creation)
3. Similar items recommendations (User engagement)

### Phase 2 (Enhanced Discovery)
4. Semantic search (Better search results)
5. Virtual fashion assistant chatbot (User engagement)
6. Styling tips generator (Added value)

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
7. Visual search (Innovative feature)
8. Trend analysis (Business insights)
9. Virtual try-on (Competitive advantage)

## Technical Requirements

### APIs Needed
- OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL-E, Embeddings)
- Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector)
- Image processing (remove.bg, Cloudinary)

### Infrastructure
- Increased backend compute for AI processing
- Vector database hosting
- API key management and security
- Rate limiting for AI endpoints

### Cost Considerations
- OpenAI API costs (pay per token/request)
- Vector database hosting
- Increased storage for embeddings
- Cache responses where possible to reduce API calls

## Getting Started

1. **Set up OpenAI API**
   ```bash
   npm install openai
   ```

2. **Add environment variable**
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. **Create AI service module**
   ```javascript
   // backend/services/aiService.js
   const OpenAI = require('openai');
   const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
   
   // Implement AI functions here
   ```

4. **Start with one feature** (e.g., auto-tagging)
   - Add endpoint to backend
   - Integrate with admin UI
   - Test and refine prompts

## Best Practices

- **Prompt Engineering**: Spend time crafting effective prompts for consistent results
- **Error Handling**: AI APIs can fail or timeout - handle gracefully
- **Caching**: Cache AI responses to reduce costs and latency
- **User Feedback**: Allow users to rate AI suggestions to improve over time
- **Transparency**: Make it clear when AI is being used
- **Privacy**: Never send user personal data to third-party AI services without consent
