# Jiraibrary

Jiraibrary is a visual catalog and searchable archive of **Jirai Kei** fashion, inspired by projects like [Lolibrary](https://lolibrary.org/).  
The MVP focuses on searchable data, clear item presentation, and an admin workflow that enables **AI-assisted data entry** in future updates.

## üß≠ App Flow Overview

### Core Views (MVP)

1. **Home**  
   - Displays all **brands** in responsive grid cards.  
   - A top **search bar** (with filter icon) floats at the top.  
   - Clicking a brand navigates to its brand details or filters items by that brand.

2. **Search**  
   - Triggered when a user types into the home search bar.  
   - Dedicated `/search` page includes:  
     - Sidebar: advanced filters (brand, tag, category, year).  
     - Main area: grid of item cards matching the query.  
   - Each card shows a thumbnail, name, brand, and tags.

3. **Item Details**  
   - Dedicated `/item/[id]` route with full details:  
     - Name, Brand, Description, Year, Tags, Category, Image(s).  
     - **References** list ‚Äî each hyperlink applies a new search scoped to that reference (e.g., brand, collection, tag).

### Next Tier (Post-MVP)

- **Navbar:** Persistent navigation with Home, Search, and Login buttons.  
- **User Login:** Simple user auth for favorites and submissions.  
- **Admin Login:** Django admin for managing items, tags, and brands.  
- **Add Entries:** Authenticated page to propose or upload new clothing items (with image preview and tags).

### Day 2 ‚Äì Models & API

**Define models in Django**
- `Brand`
- `Tag`
- `Item`

**Set up**
- Serializers & REST endpoints (Django REST Framework)
- Connect S3 for image upload (`boto3` + `django-storages`)
- Test CRUD via Django Admin

---

### Day 3 ‚Äì Next.js UI

**Create pages**
- `/` ‚Üí Item list with filters
- `/item/[id]` ‚Üí Item detail
- `/brand/[name]`, `/tag/[name]` ‚Üí filtered views

**Frontend tasks**
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Fetch data via Axios (or `fetch`) from Django API

---

### Day 4 ‚Äì Image Upload & AI Integration

**Image upload**
- Integrate AWS S3 image upload in admin (upload + serve from S3)

**AI helper (optional)**
- Add a simple AI tagging helper
  - Script or endpoint that calls OpenAI / CLIP
  - Example flow: send item description + image URL ‚Üí receive suggested tags
- Present suggestions in admin for human confirmation before saving

---

### Day 5 ‚Äì Search, Filter, and Polish

- Implement search bar + brand/tag/category filtering
- Add pagination or infinite scroll for long result sets
- Improve visual styling and UI consistency (spacing, fonts, image aspect ratios)

---

### Day 6 ‚Äì Testing & Debugging

- Test item CRUD in Django Admin
- Test frontend filtering, browsing, and search end-to-end
- Ensure S3-hosted images render correctly in all views
- Prepare production `.env` files and document required environment variables

---

### Day 7 ‚Äì AWS Deployment

**Backend (Django)**
- Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk (or Lightsail)
- Configure environment variables / secrets
- Connect to AWS RDS (Postgres)
- Ensure static/media handling with S3

**Frontend (Next.js)**
- Deploy to AWS Amplify or Vercel
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to point to backend API

**Infrastructure to configure**
- AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
- S3 bucket for media
- Route 53 DNS for `jiraibrary.org`
- HTTPS via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

---

## AI Integration (Phase 1)

**Overview**
- Optional but recommended as an admin helper

**Workflow**
1. Admin uploads an image (or links an image URL).
2. Backend sends the image (and optional text) to an AI model (e.g., CLIP, GPT-4o-mini).
3. AI returns suggested tags, categories, or probable brand.
4. Admin reviews & confirms suggestions ‚Üí saves to database.

**Implementation options**
- Local inference: Hugging Face `transformers` (CLIP/BLIP) for embeddings/captions
- Hosted APIs: OpenAI / Anthropic for captioning and structured extraction

## Cost Estimates

| Service                         | Est. Monthly Cost      |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| AWS EC2 (Elastic Beanstalk)     | $10‚Äì15                |
| AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)            | $10‚Äì15                |
| AWS S3                          | $1‚Äì5                  |
| Route 53 Domain                 | ~$12 / year           |
| AI API usage                    | Variable (~$5‚Äì10 light use) |

---

## Future Roadmap

- AI-assisted image classification & tagging  
- Image similarity / visual search (vector DB: FAISS / Pinecone)  
- Automated web crawling for fashion entries (with human confirmation)  
- Community contributions: user submissions & moderation queue  
- User accounts & favorites system  
- Donation / premium tier to sustain hosting costs

---

## Notes

- Keep MVP focused on **CRUD + browsing + filtering**.  
- AI and auto-crawling are **Phase 2** enhancements.  
- Always document **why** a step or decision is made (learning-first approach).  
- Keep commits small and descriptive to aid learning and rollback.
